# Exercise 1: Calculate Area of a Triangle
#
# Write a function named `calculate_area_triangle` that takes the base and height of a triangle and returns the area.
# The area formula is (base * height) / 2.
#
# Examples:
# calculate_area_triangle(10, 5) should return 25.0.
# calculate_area_triangle(7, 3) should return 10.5.
#
# Define your function and call it below.

# ! Normal
# def calculate_area_triangle(base, height):
#     return (base*height) / 2

# ! Lambda attempt
calculate_area_triangle = lambda base, height: (base*height) / 2

print('Exercise 1:', calculate_area_triangle(10, 5))


# Exercise 2: Calculate Simple Interest
#
# Write a function named `simple_interest` that takes principal, rate of interest (as a percentage), and time (years).
# Calculate and return the simple interest using the formula (principal * rate * time) / 100.
#
# Examples:
# simple_interest(1000, 5, 2) should return 100.
# simple_interest(1500, 3.5, 5) should return 262.5.
#
# Define your function and call it to see the result.

def simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    return (principal * rate * time) / 100

print('Exercise 2:', simple_interest(1000, 5, 2))


# Exercise 3: Apply a Discount
#
# Write a function named `apply_discount` that takes a product's price and a discount percentage (from 0 to 100).
# Return the new price after applying the discount.
#
# Examples:
# apply_discount(100, 25) should return 75.
# apply_discount(80, 10) should return 72.
#
# Define your function and call it to display the discounted price.

def apply_discount(price, discount_percentage):
    discount = (price * discount_percentage) / 100
    return price - discount

print('Exercise 3:', apply_discount(100, 25))


# Exercise 4: Convert Temperature
#
# Write a function called `convert_temperature` that takes a
# temperature and a unit ('C' for Celsius, 'F' for Fahrenheit)
# and converts the temperature to the other unit.
# The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is (Celsius * 9/5) + 32.
# The formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9.
#
# Examples:
# convert_temperature(0, 'C') should return 32.0.
# convert_temperature(32, 'F') should return 0.0.
#
# Define the function and then call it below.

def convert_temperature(temperature, unit):

    # Experimenting with doc strings.
    """ This function converts temperature """
    
    # ! I've been experimenting with error handling / validation in Python but can't seem to manage this 'gracefully'. It always throws Python's own error if a non-string is provided as the unit argument.

    try: 
        unit = unit.upper()
    except TypeError:
        print("Error: Unit must be a string")
        
        if unit not in ('C', 'F'):
            print("Error: Unit must be 'C' for Celsius or 'F' for Fahrenheit.")
            return 
        
        if unit == "C":
            return (temperature * 9/5) + 32
        elif unit == "F":
            return (temperature - 32) * 5/9
        

print(convert_temperature.__doc__)
print('Exercise 4: Convert 0°C to Fahrenheit:', convert_temperature(0, 'C'))
print('Exercise 4: Convert 32°F to Celsius:', convert_temperature(32, 'F'))

# Exercise 5: Sum to N
#
# Write a function named `sum_to` that takes a single integer n and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n.
#
# Examples:
# sum_to(6) should return 21.
# sum_to(10) should return 55.
#
# Define the function and then call it below.

def sum_to(n): 
    return sum(range(1, n+1))

print('Exercise 5:', sum_to(6))


# Exercise 6: Find the Largest Number
#
# Write a function named `largest` that takes three integers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
#
# Examples:
# largest(1, 2, 3) should return 3.
# largest(10, 4, 2) should return 10.
#
# Define your function and test it with different inputs.

def largest(n1, n2, n3):
    if n1 >= n2 and n1 >= n3:
        return n1
    elif n2 >= n1 and n2 >= n3:
        return n2
    else:
        return n3

print('Exercise 6:', largest(1, 2, 3))


# Exercise 7: Calculate a Tip
#
# Create a function called `calculate_tip`. It should take the bill amount and the tip percentage (as a whole number).
# The function should return the amount of the tip.
#
# Examples:
# calculate_tip(50, 20) should return 10.
#
# Write your function and test its output below.

def calculate_tip(amount, percent):
    return amount * percent / 100

print('Exercise 7:', calculate_tip(50, 20))


# Exercise 8: Calculate Product of Numbers
#
# Write a function named `product` that takes an arbitrary number of numbers, multiplies them, and returns the product.
# Review your notes on *args for handling an arbitrary number of arguments.
#
# Examples:
# product(-1, 4) should return -4.
# product(2, 5, 5) should return 50.
#
# Define the function and call it with different sets of numbers to test.

def product(*nums):
    # ! this was a bit tricky to remember to provide an 'accumulator'
    total = 1
    for num in nums:
        total = total * num
        # logic: 
        # grabs 2 and times it by 1; 
        # 2 is then in the total accumulator and is used to times 5 
        # the total is then 10, so we times is by 5 to get 50
    return total

print('Exercise 8:', product(2, 5, 5))


# Exercise 9:

def basic_calculator(a: int, b: int, operator: str):
    #Following tristan's convention, I've included notes on expected values of arguments ^
    if operator == "add":  
        return a + b
    if operator == "subtract":
        return a - b
    if operator == "multiply":
